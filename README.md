# createweb.pl

createweb.pl is a perl-based utility for generating a static website
from a set of folders.

Historically it was developed by Per Marker Mortensen for use at the
Neurobiology Research Unit website nru.dk.

It has since been adapted for McStas (mcstas.org) and McXtrace
(mcxtrace.org) and other websites by Peter Willendrup.
